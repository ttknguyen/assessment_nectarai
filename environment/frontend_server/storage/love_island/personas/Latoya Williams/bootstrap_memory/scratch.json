  "daily_plan_req": "Latoya Williams wakes up at 6am and starts her day with a morning walk around the villa, often capturing the sunrise on her camera. By 7am, she joins the Islanders for breakfast, where her attentiveness and analytical nature make her a great listener. Mornings are spent participating in villa activities, where Latoya enjoys observing and documenting moments with her photography. Around 1pm, she joins the group for lunch, often engaging in discussions about travel and storytelling. Afternoons are her creative hours, where she experiments with photography techniques and collaborates with others for impromptu photo sessions. In the evening, she participates in recoupling ceremonies or group gatherings, always with her camera ready to capture memories. Latoya winds down around 10pm, organizing her photos and reflecting on the dayâ€™s connections and events.",
